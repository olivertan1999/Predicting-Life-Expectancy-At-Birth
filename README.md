# Predicting Life Expectancy At Birth In Different Countries Using Classification Algorithms

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to predict the life expectancy at birth in different countries using two classification algorithmns, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree Classifier.
We will also explore and compare 2 different techniques, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Feature Engineering, in improving the performance of the classification algorithm.
